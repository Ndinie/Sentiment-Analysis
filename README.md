# Sentiment Analysis Prediction on IMDB review

## Project Description
IMDB dataset that we referred has 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. 
We provide a set of 35,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 15,000 for testing. 
This project is to create a LSTM model to classifiy if a review is positive or negative using either classification or deep learning algorithms.
